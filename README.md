# ES-Theme-CarbonX
Carbon fiber inspired theme, wanted to make a theme that look like SimpleMenu EmulationStation, but for Batocera, sometimes you need simple things in life.
# Aspect Ratio :
- Made for 4/3 screens, 640x480 resolution,  Handheld Console
  
# Gamelist View Style :
- BASIC

- GRID
  
# Backgrounds :
